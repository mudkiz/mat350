Create the matrix C.
C =[2 1 3 1;1 2 0 3;-2 2 3 7];%matrix C
%Use the rref() command to reduce the matrix C.  Store the reduced matrix in rowreducedC, and 
%store the pivot variables in pivotvarsC.
[rowreducedC, pivotvarsC] = rref(C);% variables for reducing the matrix
%Use the "format rat" option to express elements as ratios.
format rat;%express the given elements as ratios
