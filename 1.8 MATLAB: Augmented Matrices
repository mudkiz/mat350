%Create the coefficient matrix A.
A = [1 3 -2 0 2 0; 2 6 -5 -2 4 -3; 0 0 1 5 0 3; 1 3 0 4 2 9];% matrix based off the linear equations above
%Create the column matrix b of constants. Remember, to create a column matrix, the rows are separated 
%by semicolons.
b = [0; -1; 1; 3];% columns based on the numbers on the right side of the equal sign above
%Create the augmented matrix [A | b|.  Store this augmented matrix in Ab.
Ab = [A, b];%stores augmented matrix
%Use the rref() command to reduce the augmented matrix.  Store the reduced matrix in rowreducedAb, and 
%store the pivot variables in pivotvarsAb.
[rowreducedAb , pivotvarsAb] = rref(Ab);
%Warning:  Look carefully at the reduced augmented matrix.  If one of the pivot columns is the rightmost 
%column, the system of linear equation has no solution and no further analysis is possible.

%Do you run into any difficulties?  Explain what is happening as a comment in your code.
 %i had mistyped line 3 and forgot the 0 so I kept getting an error saying that my dimensions were inconsistent 
 %then i realized i had made a number negative that didnt need to be so my matrix A was incorrect.
%Use the size command to find the number of variables in the system of linear equations.  Store this number 
%in numvars.
[numeqns, numvars] = size(A);

%Use the size command to find the number of pivot variables.  Store this number in numpivotvars.
[numrows, numpivotvars] = size(pivotvarsAb);

%Use subtraction to find the number of free variables in the solution to the system of linear equations.  
%Store this number in numfreevars.
numfreevars = numvars - numpivotvars;
